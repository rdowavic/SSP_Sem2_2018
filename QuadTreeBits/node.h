/**
 * So the Link constructor and destructor got implicitly
 * deleted because they weren't happy that the
 * Node class has a non-trivial default constructor.
 * I get that it's not trivial because it involves initialising that array
 *
 * but I am not sure how or if it's possible to get the variant
 * field 'node' to still have a non-trivial default constructor and have this still work
 *
 *
 * I remember them mentioning something about having to implement all the stuff for yourself
 * and then it will be fine
 *
 * If a union contains a non-static data member with a non-trivial
 * special member function (copy/move constructor, copy/move assignment,
 * or destructor), that function is deleted by default in the union and needs
 * to be defined explicitly by the programmer.
 * If a union contains a non-static data member with a non-trivial default constructor,
 * the default constructor of the union is deleted by default unless a variant member
 * of the union has a default member initializer .
